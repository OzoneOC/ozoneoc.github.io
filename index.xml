These notes are for memory overclocking Samsung B-Die on chips such as the 12700K or 12900K; higher end unlocked Alderlake chips with better IMCs.
This is not a guide on how to overclock memory, it&amp;rsquo;s only notes exclusive to Alderlake as it can be trickier than normal. If you want to learn how to OC memory, read the MemTestHelper DDR4 OC Guide by by integralfx.
Special thanks to users _L_, ReZ, Mobama, Seby and QXE for helping.</description></item><item><title>Custom Watercooling</title><link>/posts/cooling/custom-watercooling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cooling/custom-watercooling/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fans</title><link>/posts/cooling/fans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cooling/fans/</guid><description>
Case fans are more important than people believe they are and can tend to make a notable difference in thermal performance
Information # Static Pressure # Static pressure is the amount of pressure exerted in the direction of the fan is pushing the air, which will help it with cooling in situations with restrictive airflow, such as radiators. This will make fans that are optimised for static pressure perform better on radiators compared to ones that aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item></channel></rss>
