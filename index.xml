Case fans are more important than people believe they are and can tend to make a notable difference in thermal performance
Information # Static Pressure # Static pressure is the amount of pressure exerted in the direction of the fan is pushing the air, which will help it with cooling in situations with restrictive airflow, such as radiators. This will make fans that are optimised for static pressure perform better on radiators compared to ones that aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item></channel></rss>
