title: Custom Watercooling
---

Custom watercooling is a high level form of watercooling usually used to cool components that draw a significant amount of power while getting very warm. This usually consists of cooling your CPU or GPU (or both, obviously), but people have also cooled their memory or even storage. 

# Parts

#### Waterblocks

These are mounted to the component desired to cool with fittings attatched to connect the tubing to it, in order to connect it to the rest of the loop. Blocks are generally made out of copper and aluminium, with copper having better thermal performance, but being more expensive

#### Radiators

These parts responsable for cooling down the loop. They come in many different sizes, with each size fitting either 120mm or 140mm fans (e.g. 280mm, 360mm), and like waterblocks, they are usually made from copper and aluminum with copper radiators being superior. There

#### Pumps

As the name suggests, this part pumps the liquid around the loop in order for it to circulate in order to cool the block, then get cooled by the radiator. Some pumps are better and more expensive than others, better pumps being more necesarry if you have larger and more radiators.

#### Fittings

In order to connect the tubing to each watercooling part, fittings are required to connect them without having any leaks at all. There are different types of fittings such as compression and barb used for soft tubing, hardtube fittings for hard tubing, and quick disconnect fittings to quickly drain loops, primarily for soft tubing. Fittings can be at different sizes to fit different sizes and thickness of tubing.
