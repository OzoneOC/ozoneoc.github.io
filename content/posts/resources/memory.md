## ICs

#### DDR4 IC Tier List from [MemTestHelper](github.com/integralfx/MemTestHelper/blob/oc-guide/DDR4%20OC%20Guide.md)
| Tier | ICs | Description |
| :-:  | :-: | :--:        |
| S | S8B | Best DDR4 IC for all-around performance |
| A | H8D, M8E<sup>1</sup>, M16B | Top Performing ICs. Known not to clock wall and generally scale with voltage. |
| B | H8C, N8B, S4E | High-end ICs with the ability to run high frequencies with good timings. |
| C | H8J, H16M, H16C, M16E, S8D | Decent ICs with good performance and decent frequency scaling. |
| D | H8A, M8B, S8C, S4D | Low-end ICs commonly found in average cheap kits. Most are EOL and no longer relevant. |
| F | H8M, M4A, S4S, N8C | Terrible ICs unable to reliably attain even the highest standard of the base JEDEC Specification. |
