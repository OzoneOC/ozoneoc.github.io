Information # Static Pressure # Static pressure is the amount of pressure exerted in the direction of the fan is pushing the air, which will help it with cooling in situations with restrictive airflow, such as radiators. This will make fans that are optimised for static pressure perform better on radiators compared to ones that aren&amp;rsquo;t.
Bearings # Bearings are the ring-like mechanism which causes the fan to rotate. Like any mechanism, they do not last for ever, hence the metric &amp;ldquo;Meantime To Failiure&amp;rdquo; (MTTF).</description></item><item><title>Memory</title><link>/resources/memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/resources/memory/</guid><description>
